# kabel/php-ext
Core PHP extension formulae for the Homebrew package manager. These extensions are not a part of [Homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/) because they are either not popular enough or have known stability problems.

Other extensions that used to be available from, the now deprecated, [Homebrew/php](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/) should be installed through [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/).

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew tap kabel/php-ext` then `brew install <formula>`

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).

**If you don't read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**
